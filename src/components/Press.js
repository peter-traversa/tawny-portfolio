      <p>"She puts her heart and soul into this gig," [Natasha] Lyonne says of Sorensen, who also worked with the actress on 'Orange is the New Black.' "I know she's got my back and I've always got hers." 2/21/19 by The Hollywood Reporter Staff</p>

      <p>"Sorensen comes off practically immersed in this story and how it all unfolds. It makes sense that she created the original story and stage play and clearly understands even the most intimate aspects of these characters yet she also possesses a naturalness, sort of lights up the screen, while also adding a strong emotional element to the film's later scenes. (...) 'The Cat's Cradle' is a valuable film telling truths and sharing insights in a way leaves you feeling its words and actions long after the closing credits have rolled."</p>

      <p>"The performances by Sorensen and Vinas throughout the film are strong, but the final minutes are especially powerful as they put all their cards on the table, and learn a lot about how each one is going to deal with a crossroads in their lives together. It’s a moment that all couples have at times in their lives together, and Spaltro and Sorensen let it play out in a way that’s meaningful for us to experience."</p>
      <h4>BOOM! Film Reviews. 4/5 Rating. Nominated for Best Actress and Best Film. (Original review no longer online)</h4>
      <p>"Authentic and compelling dialogue. Jim and Amy's conversations felt grounded and realistic which allows the audience to connect with the characters and the story. (...) Sorensen delivered a natural and convincing performance. She was able to portray lighter moments as well as dramatic and stressful ones, impressively. (...) The Cat's Cradle is a well directed and will written short film with compelling dialogue and impressive performances."</p>

      <p>"The Cat’s Cradle is an engaging, thought-provoking and important Drama from first-timer, Tawny Sorensen. It’s well shot, most of the soundtrack shines through brightly and each of the performances command your attention. Both Sorensen and Vinas have solid chemistry together and their dialogue flows organically."</p>

      <p>"You're hit with it. BANG! No way to turn back the clock. Picture a slow acceleration from zero to sixty. Paced out nicely and never pushing you back into your seat. Then, at that last minute you go from sixty to one twenty in six seconds. That's how "The Cat's Cradle" is paced, and it works like a charm. Nabil Vinas and Tawny Sorensen as Jim and Amy also feel perfectly cast. They dance around one and other just as you'd expect a married couple to do. When they begin to fight, you really feel for both of them, and maybe even understand a little why they did/do what they did/do. No question in my mind. "The Cat's Cradle" may be well written, but it's the acting that awesomely pushes it through."</p>

      <p>"Sorensen does a wonderful job as Amy, a strong-willed, independent woman and loving wife who has no hesitations about how she feels about the concept of children being introduced to what she might actually perceive is already her ideal marriage. Her playfulness with Jim on what should be a freely romantic, re-bonding encounter turns south and becomes a confessional, an unanticipated and massively awkward one at that, which puts her on the defensive and the hot seat to very unnerving degrees as everything floods out. This highly volatile session is very believably enacted by Sorensen. (...) “The Cat’s Cradle” is one unwavering, candid, sincere, and potently affecting view of how burying secrets and being dishonest in a relationship can be lead to heartbreak, regret, disappointment, and even a questioning of what was or was not mutual aspiration, the coming back from which may truly prove to be the biggest challenge that tests what should always exist at the center of it all–love."</p>

      <p>"[The Cat's Cradle is [f]ull of drama, a little comedy and some electric acting. (...) The real beauty of this movie is within the acting itself. Our two leads manage to pull off quite the performance. "The Cat's Cradle" feels more like you're a fly on the wall during a real incident, not a fictional film. The anger and sadness of Jim, played by Nabil Vinas comes through loud and clear. (...) This is matched with an excellent performance from Tawny Sorensen as Amy. As the writer of this production, she completely understood and nailed the fear and guilt required for such a part. The two play off one and other like they truly have a history and something to lose.</p>
